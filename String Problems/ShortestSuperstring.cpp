//Given a set of n strings arr[], find the smallest string that contains each string in the given set as substring. 
//We may assume that no string in arr[] is substring of another string.
//It is a NP hard problem.
//We can only implement approximate Greedy Problem.
//Read the example below:
//Input:  arr[] = {"geeks", "quiz", "for"}
//Output: geeksquizfor
//Input:  arr[] = {"catg", "ctaagt", "gcta", "ttca", "atgcatc"}
//Output: gctaagttcatgcatc
